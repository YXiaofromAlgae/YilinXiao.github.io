## About Me

A Biology Ph.D. I have been working in Microbiology, Bioimformatics, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Phycology for ten years.
A "all-rounder". A laboratory worker, a junior Bioinformatician, and a junior field worker. Know a bit about everything in research because of my "colorful and diverse" scientific research experience.

HPLC (DAD and FLD), microplate reader, TEM, ICP-MS, RT-qPCR, Transcriptome analysis and Genome sequencing has been used for my Ph.D research.

Looking for job:
A well organised lab or group;
Biology, Botany, Phycology, Microbiology, Fish or Health;
Transcriptome, Genome, and combined with lab experiments;
aboard (because I have never been aboard).
